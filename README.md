# F1L
The repository contains projects associated with the Figure 1 Lab (F1L) initiative from Dean Lee. The goal of F1L is to develop compbio skills through reproduction of Figure 1 from scientific publications. 

## F1L Internship Emulator
Over the next 6 weeks, I will attempt to answer the following question posed by the inaugural F1L Internship Emulator:

> In this iteration of the F1L Internship Emulator, participants will play the role of a compbio intern in biotech/pharma. The intern is given this open-ended question: Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in other cancers?
> + Trastuzumab: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.
> + Bevacizumab: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.

### Key Scientific Question (KSQ)
> Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?
Trastuzumab: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.
Bevacizumab: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.

## Memo
The KSQ asks us to explore the potential utility two FDA-approved molecularly targeting agents in other cancers that are currently not approved indications. Specifically, it asks us to use scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines as a resource of explore this question. 

A key assumption behind the potential efficacy of these drugs is that the treated cancer cells expresses the target of these agents. In other words, a given cancer cell line may potentially be treated with Trastuzumab or Bevacizumab if they express the targets HER2 or VEGF, respectively. In addition, the cancer cells must also depend on these targets, such that they are sensitive to the loss of these targets. For example, HER2-positive breast cancers expresses very high levels of HER2 and have a dependency on HER2 activity for their survival and are sensitive to Trastuzumab. 

Cancer cell lines are the gold standard pre-clinical workhouse for cancer biologists. They are important models for the drug discovery pipeline. As such, there have been a tremendous effort in the community to characterize the sensitivity of anti-cancer agents and even existing FDA-approved drugs to large number of cancer cell lines. The [Cancer Cell line Encyclopedia and depmap portal](https://depmap.org/portal/ccle/) are useful resources that can help us answer the KSQ.

Lastly, we will be using scRNA-seq of cancer cell lines to answer the KSQ. The ability of scRNA-seq to dissect the hetergeneity of cancer cell lines will be integral for identifying the expression of the targets of Trastuzumab or Bevacizumab.
